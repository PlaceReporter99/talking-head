# TalkingHead

A programming language where you talk instead of type.

## Commands
### Splitting
`after that` splits each command.
### Leading
`push` pushes the given stuff to the stack. Follow with the stuff you want to push.
`pop` pops the stack. pops the last item by default, you can specify it to pop an index.
`execute` executes python code.
### Trailing
`bite` states that the text is given in hex bytes instead of literal speech.
`input` does not work with pop, follow it by a prompt.
## Other stuff
"bite" has been made to replace "bike" due to interpretation issues.
